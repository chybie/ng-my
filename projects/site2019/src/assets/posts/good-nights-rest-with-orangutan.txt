## Good nightâ€™s rest with Orang Utan
Have you scored a ticket already? Awesome! Now the next step: booking a place to catch some ðŸ˜´ðŸ’¤ 's before the next day of fun at NG-MY! Budget-friendlyðŸ’¸ or go fancy ðŸ¥‚? No problem, Orang Utan has got some recommendations for you!

Some of these suggestions may not be simply a walking distance away from Sunway University. However, for a convenient alternative to travel, we do have our Malaysian version of an uber, which is Grab. ðŸš— https://www.grab.com/my/ 

Just a disclaimer, we are not affiliated with any of these suggestions. 

#### Sunway Pyramid Hotel 
![Sunway Pyramid Hotel](04-sunway-pyramid-hotel.jpg)
For a quick, convenient travel distance to Sunway University, we recommend Sunway Pyramid hotel. Sunway Pyramid Hotel is roughly 15 - 20 minutes walking distance if you choose to walk in the mall and cross a bridge. It is also an 8 minutes drive away from Sunway University.

The website, Agoda, does offer great discounts, so make sure you also check and compare the price in other booking sites! The price is estimated to be around RM350++ per night (normal RM720++)!

#### Sunway Resort Hotel & Spa
![Sunway Resort Hotel and Spa](04-sunway-resort-spa.jpg)
*Ada duit?* (Got money?) If youâ€™re open to spending extra $, you can opt for Sunway Resort Hotel & Spa! Nothing more worth spending than a good massage to relieve stress. Mandara Spa offers more than 30 options of relaxing aromatherapy massages, body wraps, facials, manicure and pedicure, and scrubs to clear your mind- starting from RM95 for a Spa Manicure up to RM705 for its Ultimate Indulgence package. 

Sounds relaxing already, doesnâ€™t it? [Look through the Spa Menu.](https://srhsstaging.fxi-services.com/Portals/3/Folders%20by%20SRHS/PDF/Mandara%20Spa/MSM-Sunway-English%20March'16.pdf)

Want to spend those extra minutes sleeping in instead of driving? (Me too.) Another option is to go for Sunway Clio! Previously Sunway Pyramid West Hotel, Sunway Clio is 3 minutes by car away from Sunway University.

For some suggestions on budget hotels, we recommend hotels that are located opposite Sunway Pyramid, within the shoplots. These hotels are strategically located close to Sunway University, and even closer to Sunway Pyramid. Therefore, the walking distance to Sunway University is roughly 20 minutes. It is recommended to take a grab or drive there for easy travel. As for pricing, all of them are in the RM46 to RM94 per room range area. All of these prices are filtered for 1 person staying in 1 room from 5th July to 8th July.
