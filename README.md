## How to create a new post
1. Create a PR
2. Add your new post introduction in `/projects/site2019/src/assets/data/posts.json` follow the existing format - the details here will be used for both the web content & SEO
3. Create a text file in `/projects/site2019/src/assets/posts` follow the other existing post. The file name **must be same as the post id you create in previous step**. File content is in `markdown` format. You can use `https://dillinger.io` to write your articles in markdown and previous it.
4. If you have any images that you want to upload, can add to this folder: `/projects/site2019/src/assets/imgs/posts`. The file name is not restricted, you can put any. In your article you can refer to the image with url like this `/assets/imgs/posts/{your-image-name}.jpg`. Always reduce your image size with `https://squoosh.app/` before upload.
